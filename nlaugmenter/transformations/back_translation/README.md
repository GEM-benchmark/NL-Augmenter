# Back Translation🦎  + ⌨️ → 🐍
This transformation translates a given English sentence into German and back to English.

## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation acts like a light paraphraser. Multiple variations can be easily created via changing parameters like the language as well as the translation models which are available in plenty.

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks which have a sentence/paragraph/document as input like text classification,
text generation, etc.

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
The transformation's outputs are dependent on the accuracy of the individual translation models and generally would generate simpler text or more popularly used text.
