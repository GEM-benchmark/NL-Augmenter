## What type of a filter is this?

This filter allows to select questions that can be correctly answered with either 'yes' or 'no'.

## Why is measuring performance on this split important?

Questions formed this way can have a definitive, short answer. Furthermore, their focus on auxiliary verbs make them prone to paraphrasing

## What are the limitations of this filter?

Questions that are ambiguous might not be recognized by this filter - for example a sentence like "Would you or your wife like some tea?" will get marked as a regular question, not a yes/no one.
