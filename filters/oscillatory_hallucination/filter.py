    Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.06683.pdf
    The paper did not explicitly tokenize since IWSLT is available in tokenized form.
    Tokenization used here = Whitespace + Punctuation, as in multilingual BERT pre-tokenization.
    Finally, one more difference with the paper: Count Threshold is also set along with Difference Threshold.
    Thresholds are set to very high values to ensure very High Precision of the Filter, but this can be tweaked.
