## Language filter

## What type of a filter is this?
This filter returns a list of texts that match any of a given set of ISO 639-1 language codes (defaults to ['en']). 
Language matching is performed using a pre-trained ``langid.py`` model instance. 
The model provides normalized confidence scores, so we allow the user to specify the minimum required probability to 
return a positive result (defaults to 0.5). 

More model details can be [found here](https://github.com/saffsd/langid.py).

## Why is measuring performance on this split important?

This filter can help remove texts in languages other than the desired set, promoting more rapid and efficient training.

## What are the limitations of this filter?

Requires >= Python 2.7 and numpy.

Langid.py is pre-trained on the following languages (ISO 639-1 codes):
