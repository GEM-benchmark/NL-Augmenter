## Use Cases
This filter can be helpful to find text with repetitions that frequently occur in the spoken language data.

## Limitation
One obvious limitation is that of not being able to differentiate from sentences with "epizeuxis" - the repetition of a word or phrase in immediate succession, typically within the same sentence, for vehemence or emphasis (Wikipedia). Future work could involve differentiating between these two forms. There is a bit of recent implementation of one such tool called the https://github.com/text-processing/prose-rhythm-detector
