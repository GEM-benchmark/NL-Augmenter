## Phonetic Match filter

## What type of a filter is this?
This filter returns texts that contain matching entries to a list of supplied keywords, 
evaluated by reducing each token to a phonetic representation.

## Why is measuring performance on this split important?

This filter can help to create more inclusive domain-related splits by relaxing the need to account for 
incorrect spellings. It can also help to include more texts that include related stem words.
