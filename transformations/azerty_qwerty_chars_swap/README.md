# Multilingual Keyboard Change: AZERTY / QWERTY
This transformation acts like a perturbation by replacing some characters regarding a possible change of keyboard. Given a character `c_qwerty` located at a certain position in a QWERTY or QWERTZ keyboard, it is replaced with the character `c_azerty` located at the same position of an AZERTY keyboard.

## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation acts like a perturbation and makes lexical replacement.

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks which have a sentence/paragraph/document as input like text classification, text generation, etc.
