    # Tony's note about the sliding window implementation / stride parameter (08.21.2020):

    # By default, the stride parameter is set to 1. This means that we find the average log probability of each token
    # after the first one (so n-1 probabilities), and then find the perplexity of the sentence. There is a
    # Huggingface implementation of GPT-2 that allows users to get the log probabilities of each token all at once,
    # which is significantly faster than calculating each probability one token at a time. I could be wrong,
    # but I believe the reason that we do not find the probability of the first token is that the Huggingface
    # implementation does not use a start-of-sentence token. This means that the first word becomes the first token
    # upon which the following words are conditioned.

    # For the purpose of rewriting / translating sentences, using a stride of 1 is preferred. However, due to the
    # fixed-length nature of certain models like GPT-2, if the input happens to be longer than the fixed length,
    # calculating perplexity can be a bit tricky. The default approach is to split the input into segments less than
    # or equal to the max fixed length, and then taking some kind of average of the perplexities. This is not a bad
    # approach, but the start of each segment loses a considerable amount of context. This can lead to a higher
    # perplexity than what is reflected in the text.

    # One solution is to use a sliding window (up to size max fixed length). This means that we can use more context
    # when calculating perplexity of tokens in situations where the input length is longer than our max fixed length.
    # On top of this, we can add a stride option to calculate the perplexity every {stride} tokens instead of
    # calculating perplexity for each token in the input. The sliding window with a larger stride is a nice
    # compromise, allowing computation to proceed much faster while still giving the model a large context to make
    # predictions at each step.
