# Diverse Paraphrase Generation🦎  + ⌨️ → 🐍
This transformation produces multiple diverse paraphrases for a given sentence in English.

## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation is a multi-output sentence level paraphrase generation model, specifically catered towards generating `num_outputs` (user specified) diverse outputs. 

It has support for 4 candidate selection methods:

a) dips: Based on Kumar et. al. 2019. (See Below)\
b) diverse_beam: Based on Vijaykumar et. al 2018. (See Below)\
c) beam: Selects top `num_outputs` candidates in the beam search.\
d) random: Randomly selects `num_outputs` candidates.

Eg:
```python
>>> t = DiverseParaphrase(augmenter='dips', num_outputs=3)
>>> t.generate('Joe Biden is the President of USA.')
```

Replace augmenter with any of the above mentioned options. \
\
Default: augmenter='dips', num_outputs=3. \
In most cases, dips should be the preferred choice.

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks which need diverse paraphrase candidates for augmentation in tasks like text classification, text generation, etc.

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
The base paraphrasing model used by this transformation is backtranslation (En -> De -> En). If the base model is poor, the candidate outputs will be of low-quality.
