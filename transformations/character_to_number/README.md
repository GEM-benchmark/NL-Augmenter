# Character to number🦎  + ⌨️ → 🐍

This transformation first capitalizes a sentence and then subtitutes some letters by numbers with similar shape that remain readable for a human.

## What type of a transformation is this?

This transformation acts replacing characters by visually similar numbers

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?

This perturbation would be of special interests to those models that must first recognise hand-writting before carrying out its task. It should help increase robustness of such models, and allows them to behave more human-like.

## Previous Work

I am not aware of any.

## What are the limitations of this transformation?

While the transformation allows to control the probability of change, it is rather a constrained change, and may make no sense for systems that do not read directly from handwritting.
