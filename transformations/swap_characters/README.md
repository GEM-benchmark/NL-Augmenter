# Swap Characters Perturbation
This perturbation adds noise to all types of text sources (sentence, paragraph, etc.) by randomly swapping any two adjacent characters with a default probability of .05. (e.g. "apple" -> "aplpe", "I like pears" -> "Il ike peasr")

## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation acts as a robustness to common typographical errors. Often, when typing on a keyboard, people will accidentally swap two adjacent characters. This transformation serves a check on robustness to these common human errors.

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks which have a sentence/paragraph/document as input like text classification, 
text generation, etc. 

## Previous Work
This has been a fairly common adversarial augmentation in NLP. It is described and explored in this paper:

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
The transformation's outputs may occasionally change meaning or shift characters from word to word. If there is a high corruption rate, the meaning may be significantly changed or uninterpretable.
