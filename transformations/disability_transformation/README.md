## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation replaces outdated names for disabilities with more considerate names now used in the modern world.
For e.g. 
If the input sentence is: "After the accident, she is now a cripple."
The output will be: "After the accident, she is now a person or people with a physical disability.".
This transformation uses several different online sources for compilation of a list of offensive terms and their alternatives. All the sources are referenced below. [1]

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This transformation would benefit all tasks which intend to generate datasets with more respectful versions of terms involving people with disabilities, resulting in less offensive datasets.
 


## What are the limitations of this transformation?
The transformation may generate some nonsensical outputs as it does not consider the context of some cases.
