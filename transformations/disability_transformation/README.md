## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation replaces outdated names for disabilities with more considerate names now used in the modern world.
For e.g. 
If the input sentence is: "After the accident, she is now a cripple."
The output will be: "After the accident, she is now a person with physical disability.".


## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This transformation would benefit all tasks which intend to generate datasets with more respectful versions of terms involving people with disabilities, resulting in more diverse datasets.
 


## What are the limitations of this transformation?
The transformation may generate some nonsensical outputs as it does not consider the context of some cases.
