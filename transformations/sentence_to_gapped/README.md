# Sentence To Gapped Representation Transformation
This transformation is a sentence operation that converts sentences to their gapped forms, e.g.
"Paul likes coffee and Mary likes tea" -> "Paul likes coffee and Mary tea"

## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation acts like a perturbation to test robustness against sentences that are 
semantically equivalent but have different representation, specifically when the representations differ in gapping.

The literature in the Previous Work section describes how gapped sentences are relatively infrequent but are highly relevant
for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. The test cases are pulled from prior work on sentence gapping.

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks which have a sentence/paragraph/document as input like text classification, 
text generation, sentiment analysis, etc.

```python evaluate.py -t Homophones -task TEXT_CLASSIFICATION```
```model_name = "aychang/roberta-base-imdb"```

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
- It is difficult in complex sentences to perfectly transform sentences to their "maximally gapped" forms; this is an active area of research (see Previous Work section)
- The reverse direction is also valuable and is submitted in another transformation
