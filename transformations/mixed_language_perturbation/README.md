# Mixed Language Perturbation ü¶é  + ‚å®Ô∏è ‚Üí üêç
This perturbation translates randomly picked words in the text from English to other languages (e.g., German). It can be used to test the robustness of a model in a multilingual setting.

## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation acts as a perturbation to test robustness. Few words were picked at random with a probability and translated to the target language.

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks with a sentence/paragraph/document as input like text classification, text generation, etc.

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
The transformation's outputs are dependent on the accuracy of the individual translation models and generally would generate simpler text or more popularly used text.
