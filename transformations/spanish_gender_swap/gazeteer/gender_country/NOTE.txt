Notes on the provenance of the gender-country data:

1.) This list of names organized by country and gender was taken from the
 `gender_culture_diverse_name` transformation:

https://github.com/GEM-benchmark/NL-Augmenter/blob/main/transformations/gender_culture_diverse_name/data.json

with the following modifications:

- Names which appeared as both male and female names were removed.**
- Names consisting of 1 or 2 characters were removed.

** Except for the following names, which were kept as female, as they are more
commonly used as female names: 'Susan','Rebecca', 'Michelle','Marian','Lilian',
'Karen','Julia','Jennifer','Jade','Hanna','Guadalupe','Desire','Cora',
'Christine','Carmen','Berta','Angela','Amanda';

and the following names, which were kept as male, since they are most commonly
used as male names: 'Juan','Daniel','Gabriel','Jaime','John','Jean','Robert',
'Noah','Oliver','Jose','James'.

2.) According to the `gender_culture_diverse_name` README, this list was
compiled from the following sources:

- The World Gender Name Dictionary [1]
- The BIG-bench project [2]
- Wikipedia ([3,4])
