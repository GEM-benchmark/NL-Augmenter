## How does the transformation work?

Font Change uses the mapping from [𝓾𝓷𝓲𝓬𝓸𝓭𝓮 𝙛𝙤𝙧𝙢𝙖𝙩𝙩𝙚𝙧](https://github.com/DenverCoder1/unicode-formatter) (MIT license)
to change the font of random words in the input sentence.

Examples:

> The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

to

> The quick brown 🅵🅾🆇 ɾnɯds over the lazy ᴅᴏɢ.
