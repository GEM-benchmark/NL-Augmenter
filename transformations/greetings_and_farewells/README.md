## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation is intended to create text variants, without losing the meaning of the whole sentence. These variants can act like a perturbation, in order to check if it changes the model performance.

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks which have a sentence/paragraph/document as input like text classification, text generation, etc.

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
The transformation's outputs are too simple to be used for data augmentation. Unlike a paraphraser, it is not capable of generating linguistically diverse text.
