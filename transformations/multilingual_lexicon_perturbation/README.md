# Multilingual Lexicon Perturbation 🦎  + ⌨️ → 🐍
This perturbation translates words from any supported languages (e.g., English) to other supported languages (e.g., German) by using a multilingual lexicon. Thus, it can be used to test the robustness of a model in a multilingual setting. 

There are 100 language supported as listed below:
Afrikaans (af), Amharic (am), Arabic (ar), Asturian (ast), Azerbaijani (az), Bashkir (ba), Belarusian (be), Bulgarian (bg), Bengali (bn),
Breton (br), Bosnian (bs), Catalan; Valencian (ca), Cebuano (ceb), Czech (cs), Welsh (cy), Danish (da), German (de), Greeek (el), English (en),
Spanish (es), Estonian (et), Persian (fa), Fulah (ff), Finnish (fi), French (fr), Western Frisian (fy), Irish (ga), Gaelic; Scottish Gaelic (gd),
Galician (gl), Gujarati (gu), Hausa (ha), Hebrew (he), Hindi (hi), Croatian (hr), Haitian; Haitian Creole (ht), Hungarian (hu), Armenian (hy),
Indonesian (id), Igbo (ig), Iloko (ilo), Icelandic (is), Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Javanese (jv), Georgian (ka), Kazakh (kk), Central Khmer (km),
Kannada (kn), Korean (ko), Luxembourgish; Letzeburgesch (lb), Ganda (lg), Lingala (ln), Lao (lo), Lithuanian (lt), Latvian (lv), Malagasy (mg),
Macedonian (mk), Malayalam (ml), Mongolian (mn), Marathi (mr), Malay (ms), Burmese (my), Nepali (ne), Dutch; Flemish (nl), Norwegian (no),
Northern Sotho (ns), Occitan (post 1500) (oc), Oriya (or), Panjabi; Punjabi (pa), Polish (pl), Pushto; Pashto (ps), Portuguese (pt),
Romanian; Moldavian; Moldovan (ro), Russian (ru), Sindhi (sd), Sinhala; Sinhalese (si), Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl), Somali (so), Albanian (sq),
Serbian (sr), Swati (ss), Sundanese (su), Swedish (sv), Swahili (sw), Tamil (ta), Thai (th), Tagalog (tl), Tswana (tn), Turkish (tr),
Ukrainian (uk), Urdu (ur), Uzbek (uz), Vietnamese (vi), Wolof (wo), Xhosa (xh), Yiddish (yi), Yoruba (yo), Chinese (zh), Zulu (zu)

The multilingual lexicon is generated by using the M2M100 model, Beyond English-Centric Multilingual Machine Translation (JMLR 2021). 

Processing speed of this Multilingual Lexicon Perturbation vs (Mixed Language Perturbation)[https://github.com/gentaiscool/NL-Augmenter/tree/mixed_language_perturbation/transformations/mixed_language_perturbation] is 6.24x faster on the lexicon based one. The comparison of both perturbation are shown below:

## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation acts as a perturbation to test robustness. Few words were picked at random with a probability and translated to the target language if the word is in the lexicon dctionary.

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
The transformation only handles 3000 common English words listed on https://www.ef.com/wwen/english-resources/english-vocabulary/top-3000-words/.
