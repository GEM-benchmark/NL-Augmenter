# Dislexia Words Swap
This transformation acts like a perturbation by altering some words with mistakes that are likely to happen in the context of dyslexia. 

## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation acts like a perturbation by simulating mistakes from people suffering of dyslexia. Words are replaced by their correspondance given [a misspelled word list](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Frequently-Misspelled-Word-List-for-Dyslexia-5295631) based on common words (not grade level words). 


## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks which have a sentence/paragraph/document as input like text classification, text generation, etc.

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
Those transformations are not exausthive, and are limited to a word level replacement. More complex transformations to simulate dyslexia could be developped. Moreover, we have considered only English.
