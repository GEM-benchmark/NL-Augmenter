## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation acts like a perturbation to test robustness. Each word of the given text are randomly deleted. 

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks which have a sentence/paragraph/document as input like text classification, 
text generation, etc.

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
Some word deletion can alter the meaning of the sentence, e.g. negations.
