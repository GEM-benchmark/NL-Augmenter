# Sentence reordering
This perturbation adds noise to all types of text sources (sentence, paragraph, etc.) by randomly shuffling sentencesin the input text with coreference resolution to reduce ambiguity.

## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation could shuffle sentence order in the input text, which could test model robustness. 

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks on text classification and generation. 

Benchmark results:

- Sentiment analysis: we run sentiment analysis on a 1% sample of the IMDB dataset. The original accuracy is 956 and the perturbed accuracy is 95.2.
- Text summarization: we run text summarization on a 1% sample of the xsum dataset. The original BLEU is 15.99 and the perturbed BLEU is 9.75.

This is very similar to the `Sentence Permutation` noising method in the BART paper.

The coreference resolution model is from the following paper

We use its [AllenNLP implementation](https://demo.allennlp.org/coreference-resolution).


## What are the limitations of this transformation?

This transformation will only change the input text that has more than one sentence. 

There are still cases where coref only could not handle. For example, there could be ellipsis problems as demonstrated by [this paper on narrative reordering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.06669v1.pdf). We leave these as future work for simplicity.
