# Replace Financial amounts 🦎  + ⌨️ → 🐍
This transformation replaces consistently financial amounts throughout a text.
The replacement changes the amount, the writing format as well as the currency of the financial amount.
The change is consistent with respect to:
- the modifier used to change all amounts of the same currency throughout the text.
  - e.g., the sentence `I owe Fred € 20 and I need € 10 for the bus.` might be changed to `I owe Fred 2 906.37 Yen and I need 1 453.19 Yen for the bus.`
- the modifier used to change the amounts so that new amounts are relatively close to the original amount.
- the rate used for a change of currency reflects the actual rate on the day of use based on the forex exchange prices (this rate is fixed when using pytest).

## What type of transformation is this?
This transformation acts like a perturbation to test robustness. Generated transformations display high similarity to the 
source sentences i.e. the code outputs highly precise generations. It is a substitution of a financial amount to another financial amount. 

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks which have a sentence/paragraph/document as input like text classification, 
text generation, etc.

## Previous Work
1) This perturbation was as part of an augmentation library described by Regina and al. in (Arxiv 2020):
```bibtex

               Maxime Meyer and
               S{\'{e}}bastien Goutal},

               emails},

```

## Data and Code Provenance

The data and code used for this transformation where adapted from the code used for the paper mentioned above. 

## Common currencies
Not all currencies have conversion rate associated. For the moment, only six currencies have a conversion rate associated so that the currency can be changed to one another while keeping the converted amount close to the original amount value.
Those six currencies are: US dollar, Euro, Pound, Yen, Yuan and the Bitcoin.
The bank rate is obtained using the forex exchange prices thanks to the `forex-python` library.

Amounts corresponding to other currencies (e.g.: XAF) have just their amount modified.

## What are the limitations of this transformation?

- The transformation's outputs are too simple to be used for data augmentation as a standalone module.
However, combined with other modules, this transformation helps improve the understanding of the context, and generates simple but precise similar sentences (same semantic similarity).

- The transformation outputs financial amounts independently of the format expected for the country.
I.e. we might have `12,38 $` or `12.38 $` output by the generator.

- The transformation can only change numeric financial amounts (i.e. it will not handle "two dollars" or "14k euros").

- Finally, the transformation is case-sensitive i.e., `13 usd` will not be considered as an amount.

### Bank Rate

Currently, the bank rate is fixed and reflects the rate of August 2021.
An improvement to this transformation could be to use a library such as `https://forex-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html` to get actualized bank rates.
