# Replace nouns with hyponyms or hypernyms üë® Ô∏è‚Üí üêçüßî
This perturbation replaces common nouns with other related words that are either hyponyms or hypernyms 

## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation acts like a perturbation and makes lexical substitutions using related words.

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks which have a sentence/paragraph/document as input like text classification, text generation, etc. 

## Previous Work and References
1) The implementation of this perturbation uses Checklist.

    abstract = "Although measuring held-out accuracy has been the primary approach to evaluate generalization, it often overestimates the performance of NLP models, while alternative approaches for evaluating models either focus on individual tasks or on specific behaviors. Inspired by principles of behavioral testing in software engineering, we introduce CheckList, a task-agnostic methodology for testing NLP models. CheckList includes a matrix of general linguistic capabilities and test types that facilitate comprehensive test ideation, as well as a software tool to generate a large and diverse number of test cases quickly. We illustrate the utility of CheckList with tests for three tasks, identifying critical failures in both commercial and state-of-art models. In a user study, a team responsible for a commercial sentiment analysis model found new and actionable bugs in an extensively tested model. In another user study, NLP practitioners with CheckList created twice as many tests, and found almost three times as many bugs as users without it.",

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
The transformation's outputs are too simple while can still be used for data augmentation or to check for performance difference in tasks like sentiment classification.
