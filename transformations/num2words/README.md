## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation acts like a perturbation to test robustness. 
Input: 2 times 2 is 4.
Output: two times two is four.

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks which have a sentence/paragraph/document as input like text classification, 
text generation, etc. 

This transformation can be used to augment the dataset that contains numerical values. It helps to analyze models performance on questions which require numerical understanding. 

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
The transformation's outputs are too simple to be used for data augmentation. Unlike a paraphraser, it is not capable of generating linguistically diverse text.
