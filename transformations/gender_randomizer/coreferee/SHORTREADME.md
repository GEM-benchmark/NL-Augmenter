Coreferences are situations where two or more words within a text refer to the same entity, e.g. *__John__ went home because __he__ was tired*. Resolving coreferences is an important general task within the natural language processing field.

<b>Coreferee</b> is a Python 3 library (tested with version 3.8.7) that is used together with [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) (tested with version 3.0.5) to resolve coreferences within English, German and Polish texts. It is designed so that it is easy to add support for new languages. It uses a mixture of neural networks and programmed rules.
