## What type of a transformation is this?

This transformation segments the input Mandarin sentence using Spacy's default
Chinese NLP pipeline, then transcribes those segments (without tone markers)
using the Pinyin romanization scheme. The resulting outputs represent the
same content in a different writing system.

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?

This task would benefit any Chinese NLP task that has a
sentence/paragraph/document as input.

## Previous Work

The character-to-pinyin converter at the core of this project is a neural
model described in this paper:

```

## What are the limitations of this transformation?

Chinese word segmentation is a difficult task. This transformation relies on
Spacy's default segmentation, which is of unknown quality. Transcription to
pinyin is also non-trivial, but the model used for that step is nearly
state-of-the-art, while remaining lightweight.

## Integration Notes

This is a "heavy" transformation, meaning its dependencies are not installed in
the normal CI workflow, and its test cases are not run in the normal CI
workflow. The dependencies for this transformation can be explicitly
installed in the following way:

```bash
pip install -r transformations/pinyin/requirements-disable.txt
```
