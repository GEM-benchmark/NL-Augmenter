# Metaphor Substitution

This transformation augments the input sentence by making a part of it use a
metaphor instead of its literal meaning.

Author: Marek Suppa

## What type of a transformation is this?

This transformation acts like a paraphraser by changing parts of the input
sentence from their literal to metaphorical meaning. This can help check the
model's robustness and generalizability on language that contains non-literal
elements.

Some examples:

> My heart _beats_ when he walks in the room
would become
> My heart _jumps_ when he walks in the room

> After a glass of wine, he relaxed up a bit
would become
> After a glass of wine, he loosened up a bit

> The tax cut will help the economy
would become
> The tax cut will uplift the economy


## What tasks does it intend to benefit?

This perturbation would benefit all tasks which take a sentence / paragraph /
document as input like text classification or text generation and possibly even
summarization, and question answering.

## What are the limitations of this transformation?

Metaphor generation / substitution is an open area of research, with the
current state-of-the-art systems being prone to generating sentences whose
meaning may diverge from that of the input sentence.
