**1. What are neopronouns?**

Answer: _Neopronouns are a category of new (neo) pronouns that are increasingly used in place of ‚Äúshe,‚Äù ‚Äúhe,‚Äù or ‚Äúthey‚Äù when
referring to a person. Some examples include: xe/xem/xyr, ze/hir/hirs, and ey/em/eir. Neopronouns can be used by
anyone, though most often they are used by transgender, non-binary, and/or gender nonconforming people._

In the image below, we can find the temporal variations in neopronoun usage over the past few years from the **_Gender Census 2021: Worldwide Report_**.

The chart shows the resurgence of neopronoun usage of "xe", "fae" and "it" and a decrease in usage of "spivak" and "ze" over time.

## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation performs **_grammatically correct substitution_** from english to english of the gendered pronouns he/she in a given sentence with their neopronoun counterparts. The reason why a simple look-up-table approach might not work as depending on the context, the _case_ can belong to the _Nominative/Subject Pronouns,	Accusative/Object Pronouns,	Pronominal Possessive/Possessive Adjectives,	Predicative Possessive/Possessive Pronouns	or Reflexive Pronouns_ categories.


Example:
```
He like himself. ‚ÜîÔ∏è Ey likes emself **OR** Ze likes zirself etc.
```

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
As things stand, NLP models such as those deployed for neural translation fail to recognize the neopronouns and often treats them as proper nouns. For example, Google translate translates the sentence _Ve likes verself_ to ‡≤µ‡≥Ä ‡≤§‡≤®‡≥ç‡≤®‡≤®‡≥ç‡≤®‡≥Å ‡≤§‡≤æ‡≤®‡≥á ‡≤á‡≤∑‡≥ç‡≤ü‡≤™‡≤°‡≥Å‡≤§‡≥ç‡≤§‡≤æ‡≤®‡≥Ü into Kannada which reads _(Someone named) Vee likes himself_! Also, as revealed in this survey titled [Toward Gender-Inclusive Coreference Resolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13913.pdf), _"Only 7.1% (one paper!) considers neopronouns and/or specific singular THEY."_
This transformation seeks to render the training data used in NLP pipelines more neopronoun aware so as to help tackle the downstream risks of [trans erasure](https://allthingslinguistic.com/post/118373603278/i-am-at-the-end-of-my-first-semester-of).

Benchmark Results:
* The classification task was ran on IMDB dataset with a masked language model using a 1% sample size. The original accuracy was 96% and the perturbed accuracy was 95%
