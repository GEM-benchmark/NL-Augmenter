## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation acts like a paraphraser and makes lexical substitutions.

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This transformation would benefit tasks that are focused on question answering

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
The pronouns used in the endings aren't always on point - mostly because of ambiguity. As such, this transformation shouldn't be used for tasks that require their correctness.
