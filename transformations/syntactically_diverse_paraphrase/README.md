# Syntactically Diverse Paraphrasing using Sow Reap models ü¶é  + ‚å®Ô∏è ‚Üí üêç
This transformation produces syntactically diverse paraphrases for a given input sentence in English.


## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation is capable of generating multiple syntactically diverse paraphrases for a given sentence.
The number of outputs can be specified by the user through `max_outputs`.

The model paraphrases inputs using a two step framework:
1. SOW (Source Order reWriting): This step enumerates multiple feasible syntactic transformations of the input sentence.
2. REAP (REarrangement Aware Paraphrasing): This step conditions on the multiple reorderings/ rearragements produced by SOW and outputs diverse paraphrases corresponding to these reoderings.


## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks which need paraphrases for data augmentation.

    abstract = "Paraphrasing natural language sentences is a multifaceted process: it might involve replacing individual words or short phrases, local rearrangement of content, or high-level restructuring like topicalization or passivization. Past approaches struggle to cover this space of paraphrase possibilities in an interpretable manner. Our work, inspired by pre-ordering literature in machine translation, uses syntactic transformations to softly {``}reorder{''} the source sentence and guide our neural paraphrasing model. First, given an input sentence, we derive a set of feasible syntactic rearrangements using an encoder-decoder model. This model operates over a partially lexical, partially syntactic view of the sentence and can reorder big chunks. Next, we use each proposed rearrangement to produce a sequence of position embeddings, which encourages our final encoder-decoder paraphrase model to attend to the source words in a particular order. Our evaluation, both automatic and human, shows that the proposed system retains the quality of the baseline approaches while giving a substantial increase in the diversity of the generated paraphrases.",

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
The transformation is designed to work only on single-sentence inputs. Multi-sentence inputs results in an empty string/no transformation.

The model are trained on the ParaNMT-50M dataset, which tends to be quite noisy. A better paraphrase dataset would improve performance.
