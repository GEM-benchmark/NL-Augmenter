## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation acts like a perturbation to test robustness. Few words are picked at random and spaces are added between characters (e.g., Marco -> M a r c o)

Generated transformations display high similarity to the source sentences i.e. the code outputs highly precise and readable generations.

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks which have a sentence/paragraph/document as input like text classification, text generation, etc.


## What are the limitations of this transformation?
- The transformation's outputs are very simple.
- It is not capable of generating linguistically diverse text.
- This transformation will mainly affect the perfornamce of token/word-level models, while character-level models should be much robust.
