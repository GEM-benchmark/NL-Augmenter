# Shuffle within segments
Shuffle within segments (SiS): We first split the token sequence into segments of the same label. Thus, each segment corresponds to either a mention or a sequence of out-of-mention tokens. For example, a sentence `She did not complain of headache or any other neurological symptoms .` with tags `O O O O O B-problem O B-problem I-problem I-problem I-problem O` is split into five segments: [She did not complain of], [headache], [or], [any other neurological symptoms], [.]. Then for each segment, we use a binomial distribution to randomly
decide whether it should be shuffled. If yes, the order of the tokens within the segment is shuffled while the label order is kept unchanged.

## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation shuffles the tokens in the sentence without breaking the sequences of the labels.

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks which have a sentence/paragraph/document as input like text classification, 
text generation, and most importantly, a tagging task.
This would help augment data for a NER task by keeping the labels still aligned.

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
It is possible that shuffling could change the meaning of the sentence, the meaning of the entity itself or have a negative effect on NLU tasks.

## Evaluation

Here is the performance of the model dslim/bert-base-NER on the test[:20%] split of the 

Dataset({
    features: ['id', 'tokens', 'pos_tags', 'chunk_tags', 'ner_tags'],
    num_rows: 691
})

The average accuracy on a subset of conll2003 = 81.3640468775567

The average accuracy on its perturbed set = 70.13742999132477

    abstract = "Simple yet effective data augmentation techniques have been proposed for sentence-level and sentence-pair natural language processing tasks. Inspired by these efforts, we design and compare data augmentation for named entity recognition, which is usually modeled as a token-level sequence labeling problem. Through experiments on two data sets from the biomedical and materials science domains (i2b2-2010 and MaSciP), we show that simple augmentation can boost performance for both recurrent and transformer-based models, especially for small training sets.",
