## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation acts as a perturbation to test robustness to numbers when they are presented in the text form. Currently, we support the transformation from `general number (integer)`, `date`, `time`, `year`, `currency`, `phone`, and `long number`.

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks with a sentence/paragraph/document as input like text classification, text generation, etc.

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
The transformation does not transform floating points into words.
