## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation uses a neural model finetuned for question rephrasing it is a transformer-based transformation.

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks which have a sentence/paragraph/document as input like text classification, 
text generation, etc. It has been proposed for question paraphrasing.


## Previous Work
This work relies on T5 and was finetuned following ``https://towardsdatascience.com/paraphrase-any-question-with-t5-text-to-text-transfer-transformer-pretrained-model-and-cbb9e35f1555``

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
The quality of transformation depends on the quality of the neural model and it was original proposed for dialog systems. This transformation requires a question question paraphraser.
