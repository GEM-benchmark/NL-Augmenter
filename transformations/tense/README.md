# Tense Tranformation ü¶é  + ‚å®Ô∏è ‚Üí üêç
This transformation converts sentences from one tense to the other, example: simple present to simple past. 

Author name: Tanay Dixit, Mukund Varma T

## What type of a transformation is this?

In this transformation, we convert a sentence into the target tense based on a verb, subject conjugation. 
This ensures that the context of the given sentence remains the same while the attribute of time changes. 

The following are some representative examples:

    Input: My father goes to gym every day
    Target Tense: past
    Transformed Text: My father went to gym every day

    Input: I went to the park
    Target Tense: future
    Transformed Text: I will go to the park

    Input: I will go to the park.
    Target Tense: present
    Transformed Text: I go to the park.

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?

The task is designed to measure the capacity of language understanding in language models, specifically to understand the given tense of a sentence. 
This task is nominally simple for humans, since we have an understanding of time / a sequence of events but is difficult for a language model as they do not have any prior information about time. 
There have been a couple of attempts to perform controlled attribute text transformation (Logeswaran et. al) but is yet to be seen on language models trained in a general setting.

## What are the limitations of this transformation?

The transformation is not robust to all complex cases and is limited to only simple past/present/future tense conversions.
Examples where it fails: <br>
Input: I will go for dinner after I am done playing tennis.
to_tense: past
Output: I went for dinner after I was did playing tennis.
